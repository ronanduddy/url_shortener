# URL Shortener

This is a toy Ruby on Rails app that allows user registration (signup and login) and provides the creation of shorten URLs (otherwise known as vanity links).

For example, [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com) can be input and the following will be returned for the user [http://0.0.0.0:3000/1234567](http://0.0.0.0:3000/1234567). The short URL can now be consumed by the public for marketing purposes etc.

Every time the short URL (i.e. http://0.0.0.0:3000/1234567) is used, a record will be kept on many times it has been used/clicked/viewed.

Note that no attempt has been made to make the UI look pretty. 

## Requirements

A Rails application that allows a user to get a short version of a URL from a long version, for example see [bit.ly](bit.ly).

This must be a functioning rails application considering the following:
* Users can register
* The user must be able to create a short version of a URL
* The user must be able to navigate to the long version of the url by using the shortened version
* URLs must belong to a registered user
* Count and display to the user how many times the URL has been used

Finally from the [use case diagram](use_case.PNG) the following user stories have been created in order to arrive at a good place to start:
1. As a user I want to be able to register my self to the system so that I can create short URLs
2. As a user I want to be able to create short URLs so that I can share user-friendly links with people
3. As a user I want to be able to see how many times the short URL I created has been used or viewed
4. As a user I want to be able to see all the URLs that I have created

## Installation

A prerequisite is to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). After which you can clone this repo.

To setup everything run
```Shell
make setup
```

A completely fresh or clean setup takes ~5mins.

Afterwards you should be able to go to http://0.0.0.0:3000/ to use the app. You can register a user or use a [seeded user](db/seeds.rb). The location to create short URLs is http://0.0.0.0:3000/short_urls. 

## Usage

The following command will start Rails with Postgres
```Shell
make run
```

To stop the running containers, in a different terminal window run
```Shell
make stop
```

It is also possible to SSH it the docker container by running
```Shell
make shell
```

Seed reset the database if anything unfortunate has happened with it
```Shell
make reset_db
```

For help on Docker commands, for example pruning images, containers, networks and volumnes see DigitalOcean's handy [material](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes).

## Development

To run all the tests run
```Shell
make test
```

To run guard for development
```Shell
make guard
```
